Introduction
============

CircuitPython helper library for the LSM6DSV family of motion sensors from ST.

Note that ST Electroncis makes several "LSM6DS" IMUs in their iNEMO line. However, they're not all 100% compatible. If you don't have on the following chips, you may need to use the `Adafruit_CircuitPython_LSM6DS library <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_LSM6DS>`_ instead. The code is this library is largely derived from that one, `in part to minimize library size <https://discord.com/channels/327254708534116352/327298996332658690/1307887971122413630>`_.

* LSM6DSV
* LSM6DSV16B
* LSM6DSV16BX
* LSM6DSV16X
* LSM6DSV32X

See the `ST iNEMO product page <https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/inemo-inertial-modules.html>`_ for more information.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice>`_
* `Register <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Register>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_.
